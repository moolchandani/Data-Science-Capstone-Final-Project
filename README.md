## Introduction

This report, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Coursera course, “Data Science Capstone”, concerns the R package “wordprediction”, which contains functions for an auto-completion model that predicts the next word to be typed based on a word or phrase previously typed. Course repository for the Data Science Specialization Capstone offered through Coursera from Johns Hopkins University.

### Course Dataset

The training data set listed below will be used to get started and will be the basis for most of the capstone.

### Milestone Report

Week 2 of the Data Science Capstone project covers *Exploratory Data Analysis* and *Modeling*. The goal is to develop an understanding of the various
statistical properties of the data set that can be later used when building the prediction model for the final data product.

At the end of week 2, students are asked to create a Milestone Report that includes a description of the major features of the training data based on our
exploratory data analysis and to summarize our plans for creating the text predictive model.

### Final Project Submission

The goal for this final project assignment is to implement a learning model for
text prediction. Using the text prediction algorithm, create a product in Shiny
that provides a user interface that can be accessed by users.

This repository contains the `ui.R` and `server.R` source code files for the
developed Shiny application as well as the RStudio Presenter files.

The Shiny application is hosted on shinyapps.io and the Presentation (slides)
are available on RPubs.

### Review Criteria

**Data Product**

* Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?
* Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?
* When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?
* Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?

**Slide Deck**

* Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?
* Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?
* Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?
* How would you describe the experience of using this app?
* Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?
* Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?
